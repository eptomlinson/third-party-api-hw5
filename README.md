# third-party-api-hw5

I have been having great difficulties learning Jquery> I have been unsuccessful in getting my script to work for this site. I believe that I need more time to really get this project up and running. I tried to add the moment.js as a script file and link it in the html, but for whatever reason that I cannot figure out, it isn't working. The same goes for the other script file I tried to attach. I will be meeting with my tutor on Wednesday and we will be going over Javascript/Jquery material for sure. I wanted to turn in this assignment because I did attempt to complete it. I can redo it if necessary once I have a better grip on this material. In the meantime, I am reviewing the Javascript and Jquery material, as well as looking to other sources for info to gain a better understanding of the core concept. Also, I am not sure how to add an image in the README. Thank you.
